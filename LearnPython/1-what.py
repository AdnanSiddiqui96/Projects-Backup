# What is Python?
# Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum,
# and released in 1991.
# It is used for:
# web development (server-side),
# software development,
# mathematics,
# system scripting.
# What can Python do?
# Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
# Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
# Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
# Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
# Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
# Why Python?
# Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
# Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
# Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than 
#  other programming languages.
# Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
# This means that prototyping can be very quick.
# Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
# Good to know
# The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
# However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates,
# is still quite popular.
# In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. 
# It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment,
# such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing
# larger collections of Python files.
# Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
# Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English 
# language with influence from mathematics.
# Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming
# languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
# such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages
# often use curly-brackets for this purpose.


# Python Overview
# What is Python
# Python is a dynamically typed, 
#General Purpose Programming Language that supports an object-oriented 
#programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
# Python is also an interpreted and high-level programming language.
# It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.
 

# Features of Python
# Python is simple and easy to understand.
# It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
# Python is an open-source programming language.
# Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy,
# Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
# It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.
 

# What is Python used for
# Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
# Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
# It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior
# and to learn from past data without hard coding.
# It is used to create web applications.
# It can be used to handle databases.
# It is used in business and accounting to perform complex
# mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
